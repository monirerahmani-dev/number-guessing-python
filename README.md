#Number Guessing Game in Python

In this game, the user selects a number between 1 and 10 and starts the guessing game. Let's say the user's first guess is 4. If the guess is too low, the compiler will display "Too low! Try again." The user can then enter a new guess and continue until they get the correct number and the compiler displays "You won!"

After the user wins, the compiler will ask whether the user wants to play again by displaying "Do you want to play again? (y/n)". If the user selects "y", the game will start again.
